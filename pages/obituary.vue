        Obituary - Janet (Jan) Arlene Peterson Towne
      </h2>

      <p class="text-l my-4">
        September 25, 1944 - January 26, 2022
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Janet Arlene (Peterson) Towne, known to all as Jan, was born September 25, 1944, in Quincy,
        Massachusetts.  She passed away at home in her sleep surrounded by her loved ones on
        January 26, 2022, after a long fight with COVID-19 pneumonia.  How we wish everyone would
        have taken COVID seriously in the beginning so Jan’s senseless death, and the deaths of so
        many others, could have been prevented.  We all thought we’d get to enjoy her for at
        least another 5-10 years.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Jan was the third of five children. She was born to Donald and Florence (Miller) Peterson.
        She graduated from North Quincy High.  Shortly after high school, she met and married Jeffrey
        Wheeler Towne also from Quincy. Then their 57 year adventure began.  They started their life
        together in Quincy Massachusetts and moved to Colorado Springs in 1970. After 8 years in
        Colorado Springs, they moved to Heidelberg Germany.  How she enjoyed their 8 years in Germany!
        They traveled all over Europe with their sons.  They moved back to the states to allow their
        youngest son Greg to attend an American high school.   After 7 years in Huntington Beach, CA
        they got to return to Germany for Jeff’s work again.  Jan, a fantastic hostess, loved having
        people visit them in Germany so they could take them on tours.  The lure of time with
        grandchildren brought them back to the US in 1997.  Jeff decided to retire at 55 so they
        could travel while they were still young and healthy enough to enjoy it.  They moved to
        their house in Colorado Springs in 1999.

      <p class="my-4">
        Jan, fondly known as Oma, loved Gerber daisies, camping club, her morning tea, koalas,
        chimney sweeps, traveling, playing games and taking care of her family.  More than anything
        she loved her devoted husband Jeff and all 9 of her grandchildren – Alexander, Abrianna,
        Megan, Brian, Dakota, Hope, Terrence, Ella, and Patrick.  The births of her grandchildren
        gave Jan new energy.  When she discovered her first grandchild was on the way she had to
        pull to the side of the road to calm down before she could drive again.  That excitement
        repeated with every additional grandchild.  She loved them intensely, and they were her
        pride and joy.  As each of her sons married, Jan welcomed each daughter-in-law with open
        arms and became another mother for them.

      <p class="my-4">
        Jan was a vibrant cheerful woman (like the Gerber daisies she loved) who never met a
        stranger – and she loved to talk!  She welcomed people into her life everywhere she went.
        Most of her life she was game to try anything – including sledding with her grandkids –
        until she broke her ankle.  After that she seemed to get hurt just by contemplating
        something potentially hazardous. We all joked about getting her a bubble wrap suit.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Jan chose to stay at home to care for her 3 boys and husband.  Over the years she did
        assorted part time jobs and was very active in the boys’ school and extracurricular
        activities.  In Augsburg Germany, Jan created a volunteer project to provide bi-lingual
        persons to accompany the soldiers and their families to the German hospitals.   When they
        returned to Colorado Springs, Jan volunteered at the Colorado Springs Airport at the
        Information desk.

      <p class="my-4">
        Jan is survived by her three sons, David Towne (fiancée Barbara) in Ohio,
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Russell Towne (Debra) in California and Gregory Bell-Towne (Jennifer) in Washington,
        nine grandchildren, husband Jeffrey, sister Nancy Reichert (Paul) and brothers Donald
        Peterson (Becky) and Robert Peterson (Marilyn). She was preceded in death by her parents,
        sister Beverly, and daughter-in-law Jill Towne.

        The family, who scattered around the country will gather later for a memorial service.
        A Celebration of Life for those in the Colorado area is being held on February 26, 2022,
        at Old Chicago restaurant on Academy Blvd. and Austin Bluffs Parkway from 11 am to 2pm.
        If you are planning to attend, please don’t bring a weepy condolence, but
        bring a happy story about Jan.
